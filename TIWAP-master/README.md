TIWAP is a web security testing lab made using Flask for budding security enthusiasts to learn about various web 
vulnerabilities. Inspired by DVWA, the contributors have tried their best to regenerate various web vulnerabilities

The application is solely made for educational purpose and to learn web hacking in a legal environment.
